This folder contains the necessary files to evaluate the quality of the hints generated using both tools: SpecAssistant and HiGenA.

## Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Script that takes as input a dataset of submissions and generates hints using both tools. Outputs a dataset of hints.
- `population.csv`: Dataset of submissions. Each row contains the student expression and the corresponding popularity.
- `hints.csv`: Dataset of hints generated by both tools. Output of the notebook. Each row contains the student expression, the corresponding hint generated by SpecAssistant and the corresponding hint generated by HiGenA
using different configurations.
